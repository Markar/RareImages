### RareCyte Full Stack Developer Coding Challenge

# A Service and Client for Images

Design a small REST API and a service/client combination that use it for serving images and their
metadata directly from one location on the local file system. 
A few sample images and metadata are included, these are NASA images in the public domain.  

Your service should be implemented in Python and run on a Windows PC. Use any libraries and frameworks 
you need to handle the service requests (we use flask and flask-cors). 
The client should be a single page web app using a reactive modern Javascript framework,
(we use Vue.js at RareCyte but that's not a requiement for this exercise).

Your solution should include a github link to your implementation along with instructions on how to 
install, test and run it. Send the link to pvarshavskaya@rarecyte.com 

Make the first git commit any project templates you use, so we may use git history to clearly separate
your code from boilerplate. Thanks!

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions. Please limit coding time spent on this project to 3-4 hours
at most and let us know where you would put more effort if time allowed.
